# BTC — Asset Thesis

**Status:** Core Position | Bucket B1 (Crypto)
**Current Exposure:** ~3.33 BTC spot + 4500 IBIT shares (~$475K combined, ~30% of NAV)
**Conviction:** High (long-term) / Cautious (near-term)

---

## Thesis

Digital gold + monetary hedge. Long-term structural allocation to crypto as an asset class. BTC is the core holding; IBIT provides optionality (can write options against it).

**What would change my mind:**
- Regulatory existential threat (unlikely post-ETF approval)
- Protocol-level security failure
- Superior store-of-value alternative emerges
- Sustained loss of 200-week MA with no recovery

---

## Position Management

**Approach:** Core hold with active hedging. Don't try to time perfectly — use options to manage risk.

**Hedging:** 
- IBIT protective puts in place (45 strike)
- VIX calls as tail hedge (benefits from crypto-correlated vol spikes)

**Income:**
- IBIT covered calls on strength
- CSPs to accumulate on weakness

## Cycle Context (Bob Loukas Framework)

**Current read (Feb 2026):** Late-cycle / potentially left-translated. Risk of further downside into April timeframe.

**Key observations:**
- Broke below $85K support
- Below 20-month MA
- 4-year cycle may have peaked early
- Resistance wall at $100K-$102K

**Tactical stance:** Defensive. Capital preservation > catching upside.

---

## Key Levels

- Major support: $73K, $65K
- Resistance: $100K-$102K (10-month MA, psychological)
- 200-week MA: Critical long-term level
