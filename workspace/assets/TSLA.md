# TSLA — Asset Thesis

**Status:** Core Position | Bucket B2 (AI & Growth)
**Current Exposure:** 910 shares (~$392K, ~25% of NAV)
**Conviction:** High

## Thesis

Physical AI / Robotaxi play. Betting on Tesla as an AI and robotics company, not just an automaker. The FSD + Optimus + energy storage convergence represents a multi-decade structural opportunity.

**What would change my mind:**
- FSD progress stalls or regulatory blocks emerge
- Robotaxi economics don't materialize at scale
- Competition catches up on AI training data moat
- Sustained margin compression without offsetting volume

## Active Strategy (Feb 2)

### Immediate Actions
| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Roll 360P + add collar | **HIGH** | Expiring Feb 20. Roll to March + short call |
| Income: Sell puts/calls | HIGH | Earnings done, IV crushed, deploy income |
| PMCC consideration | MEDIUM | Sell calls against LEAPs (350C, 370C) |
| 450P monetization | WAIT | Only if bounce confirmed — not yet clear |

### Strategy Notes (Steve's Direction)
- **360P Roll:** Pair with short call to create collar (reduce hedge cost)
- **Income Post-Earnings:** Sell premium now IV lower, earnings risk cleared
- **PMCCs:** LEAPs are deep ITM — can sell calls against them for income
- **450P:** Currently valuable (~$20 ITM). Could sell to monetize if bounce confirmed. Don't rush.

## Lessons Learned

- Covered calls at resistance work well (610C at 50% profit)
- Keep hedges rolling — don't let them expire
- CSPs at discount levels = willing buyer strategy
