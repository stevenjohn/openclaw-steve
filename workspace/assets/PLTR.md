## Read
- PLTR is **near the bottom of its daily range** and **near-oversold**, but still in a **bearish MA stack** with **negative momentum**.
- Base case: mean-reversion bounce is plausible **only if 126–128 holds**; otherwise next downside magnets are ~123 and ~120.

## Management / Plan Notes
- If using for income (covered calls): prefer selling calls **into a bounce** toward 134–142 resistance rather than here at support.
- If adding/holding risk: treat **<126.2** as a failure of current support zone; reassess.
