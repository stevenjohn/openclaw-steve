## Bob Loukas Cycle View (Feb 1)

**Short-term (6-8 weeks): BULLISH**
- Early in 2nd daily cycle
- Expect push to late Feb / early March
- Peak timing: Week 15-17 of weekly cycle

**Medium-term (3-6 months): CAUTION**
- Deep into 4-year cycle (~100% from 2022 lows)
- Risk of peak March-April
- Watch for failed weekly cycle

**Key Level:** January daily cycle low = defensive trigger

---

## Key Levels

- ATH: 7000 (hit recently)
- Current: ~6920
- Support: January daily cycle low (TBD)
- 200 SMA: ~6370

---

## Macro Context (Feb 2)

- **Warsh Fed Chair:** Hawkish → rates higher-for-longer
- **Gov shutdown:** Likely resolved by Tuesday (Johnson)
- **Metals crash:** Gold/silver worst day since 1980
- **Dollar:** Bouncing (headwind for risk)

---

## Active Decisions (Feb 2, 2026)

**BPS (6500/6600):** HOLD
- 6.1% cushion is solid
- Bob bullish near-term supports
- Take profit at 50%

**BCS (7100/7400):** EXIT ON BOUNCE
- Warsh shift changed risk/reward
- Don't close on gap-down open Monday
- Target exit: 6950-6980 bounce
- Hard stop: Below 6850

---

## Lessons Learned

- Macro regime shifts (Fed Chair change) can invalidate directional trades quickly
- Income trades with cushion (BPS 6% OTM) more resilient than directional bets
- "If it doesn't take off, cut it" rule — valid for directional, less so for income
