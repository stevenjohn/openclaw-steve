## Thesis

Marvell is a **leveraged play on AI infrastructure expansion** — not competing with Nvidia on GPUs, but carving critical positions in:

1. **Custom AI Silicon (ASICs)** — Designs chips for hyperscalers (AWS, Google, Microsoft)
2. **Data Center Interconnects** — Electro-optics, PAM4 modules, NVLink Fusion partnership
3. **Photonic Fabric** — Celestial AI acquisition ($1B, Feb 2026) positions for next-gen scale-up connectivity

**Why it wins in the AI wave:**
- #2 custom silicon player behind Broadcom, targeting 20% market share by 2028
- 50+ active AI opportunities, $75B lifetime revenue pipeline
- Celestial AI adds new TAM ($500M run rate by FY28, $1B by FY29)
- Trading at discount to peers with similar growth profile

## Technicals

| Level | Price |
|-------|-------|
| **Current** | $79.09 |
| **200 DMA** | $77.86 |
| **50 DMA** | $83.44 |
| **Support** | $77, $70.69 |
| **Resistance** | $81.63, $84.70, $94.65 |
| **Range** | $47.09 - $127.48 (at 26%) |

**Structure:** RANGE, consolidating in lower half after pullback from $127 highs.

---

## Entry Strategy

**Scaling in now** — 200 DMA (~$77-79) is actionable entry. Add area is $70-80 range per weekly chart.

| Zone | Price | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Current** | $79 | Scale in — at 200 DMA support |
| **Add Area** | $70-80 | Continue scaling on dips |
| **10 WMA** | ~$81 | Watching for reclaim |
| **200 WMA** | ~$65-66 | Technical last stand |

## Exit Strategy

**NOT price-target driven.** Exit triggers are thesis-based:

1. **AI bull market over** — Clear macro shift signaling AI infrastructure capex cycle has peaked
2. **Material competitive change** — MRVL loses hyperscaler deals, Broadcom dominates entirely, custom silicon thesis breaks
3. **200 WMA breakdown** — Sustained trade below ~$65 indicates structural damage

Hold through volatility as long as AI infrastructure buildout thesis remains intact.

## Analyst Consensus

- **Rating:** Strong Buy (33 Buy / 12 Hold / 0 Sell)
- **Median PT:** $115 (+45% upside)
- **Range:** $90 - $156
- **Top Bull:** Evercore ISI @ $156

## Risks

1. Customer concentration (3-4 hyperscalers)
2. In-house chip development by cloud providers
3. Broadcom dominance (~70% market share)
4. High beta / sentiment-driven volatility
5. Celestial AI integration execution

## Journal Notes

**2026-01-31 (James IA):** Bearish short-term — testing 200 DMA near $76, warned of downside to $66 on break. Break hasn't occurred; price held.

**2026-02-19:** Full research completed. Position is LEAP-only (70C x4, Jun 2027). Scaling in now at 200 DMA. Exit is thesis-driven (AI cycle over or material competitive loss), not price-target driven. 200 WMA (~$65) is technical last stand.
